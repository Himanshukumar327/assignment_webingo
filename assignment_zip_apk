Dear Team WEBINGO,

As per the instructions, I am submitting my completed Flutter assignment for the technical round.  
Please find the project repository and APK file in the following link:

Inside the folder:
- Complete Flutter Project (source code)
- APK file for testing

I have implemented all three UI designs, ensured responsiveness, and integrated APIs as required.  
Looking forward to your feedback.
